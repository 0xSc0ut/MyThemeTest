**Tools:**


- Portscan - Nmap and Masscan
- Vulnerability Scan - Searchsploit and ExploitDB

As intial recon i just started with masscan by scanning all tcp and udp ports which resulted me with

As you can see above image there are lots of open ports, so i just took those stuffs and scanned for versions using nmap

By seeing above result i just know that there are multipe ways to exploit this box.

As there are lots of port i decided to go one by one , While accessing 80 port browser throws SSL error which means we have use https protocol

As usual i just try to find exploit for elastix using searchsploit

So the challenging part is i didn’t find any version of elastix, so only way it to attempt all possible exploits,

Lets ignore XSS vulnerabilities as we have to gain access to machine i started with LFI. 

[ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37637) resulted me with exploit code, while analysing the code i found a intresting part of code

    #LFI Exploit: /vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action

As you can see the exploit can be used to read amportal.conf file from server,

From above response i thought that version should be 2.2.0, so without any delay i started checking the result.

There are lots of stuff available, using “view page source” will give a better view

Things which we care about is

 As you can see above file there are some passwords
 
I also referred etc/passwd file, which says there is a user called “fanis”

So i try to ssh fanis with the passwords which we got previously but no luck, out of no where i just thought why not “root”

**Takeaway:**

Sometimes foolish guess works
